# Cancer-info-chatbot

This is a chatbot that can hold a super basic conversation with you. Its specialty is telling you what kind of cancer you may have based on your input(physical symptoms) and then linking you some information to that specific cancer. Here are some examples(might need to click on the image to see a zoomed in version):
